May Mammon's blessing be upon you! I, the Blacksmith of Mammon, have ventured deep underground in order to offer you the highest quality weapons.<br>
I can handle your weapons and armor with this technology, which begins blacksmiths not yet learned even imitate.<br>
But first hear me out. We, the Gnomes of Mammon, not previously used the money outside. But now they are gradually coming at us in the appeal. Take this into consideration. Remove the seal with items Grade A now can only Blacksmith, present in each of the villages. In addition, we can also remove the curse of weapons Shilen. But for this we need a scroll freed from the fetters.<br>
