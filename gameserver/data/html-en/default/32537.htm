<html><body>Mouth of Ekimus:<br>
There is a narrow path among the decomposed flesh and frayed yellow bones. It is surrounded by the feel of death and the stench of decay.<br>
It seems that you must pass through the gap to secretly enter one of many <font color="LEVEL">halls</font> of the Seed of Infinity inside.<br>
