<html> <body> [R Grade Specifications] <br>
Blacksmiths can make our Guild rank R features your cheap weapons
or else to replace it. <br>
Similarly, we can make the quality grade R to your armor. Similar improvements have armor
more resistant. <br>
So say, if you do not like something out of gear - in a flash will. <br>
Rely on our masters Forge and you will be rewarded. <br>
I say this from the heart. <br>
