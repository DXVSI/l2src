If your items are too heavy, then you can leave them in our store. We work with almost all stores and banks of this continent. Items that you entrust to us, you can always pick up at any point of the earth! <br>
How is it? Think of it! After all, we were able to open an office, even here in the Ivory Tower! <br>
