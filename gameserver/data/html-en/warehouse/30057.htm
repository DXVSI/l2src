<html> <body> Warehouse Keeper Aldo:<br>
You go on a trip? I hope you are not going to carry all your stuff with you? Of course, it's not my business, but a journey is best to take only what is needed in the way. Our guild Iron Gate can take storage items as long as you do not return.<br>
In addition, you can pick up your things in any other settlement.<br>
