<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Carlon:<br>
How are things in the country of the Dark Elves? I'm really worried about the welfare of the people. Dark Elves are so desperately fought to stop the monsters Elder ... It must have been to the village now easy to pin down. At such times, the more useful to stockpile for a rainy day. If you have accumulated too much baggage, leave it to me. You can be sure that I take care of her. <br>
