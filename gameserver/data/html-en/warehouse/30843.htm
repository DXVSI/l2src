<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Romp:<br>
Even if you are close to Aden Castle, you should always be on guard. From here to the border at hand, and no one knows what will happen tomorrow. So! Once again I want to stress the need for a warehouse! Rely on us to things that are dear to you! It is not necessary to carry a lot of things. Subjects that you pass on the storage, there will be nothing to threaten. They will remain intact even if you die! <br>
