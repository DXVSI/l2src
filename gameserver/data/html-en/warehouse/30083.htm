Welcome back! You have come to pass the subject? Or pick up? Hmm ... You've seen the shop in the area where they sell only the best products? If you still did not go there, do it carefully. Is a trading shop Galaduchchi, it is as Gnome, like us. He had a strange accent, but to communicate with him - a pleasure. Do not forget to look there. He has a lot of interesting things. <br>
